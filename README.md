# Welcome To My GSoC 2024 Diary üëã
Here I will keep track of my journey and the work I will do to complete a project for QuTiP.

[QuTiP](https://qutip.org/index.html) (Quantum Toolbox in Python) is an open-source software for simulating the dynamics of open quantum systems.

[GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) (Google Summer of Code) is a global online program that brings new contributors into open source software development through 12+ week programming projects under the guidance of mentors.

## Project Summary
The Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering (GRAPE) algorithm has been implemented in QuTiP, facilitating a model-based approach to quantum optimal control.  
This project seeks to augment QuTiP's capabilities by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, including reinforcement learning and deep learning, trying to obtain better control signals to minimize the cost function (such as fidelity).  
The project will begin with an in-depth review of the latest scientific literature to define the state of the art in applying machine learning to quantum optimal control.  
‚Ä®Based on this research, I will develop one or more ML or RL models, drawing inspiration from successful implementations in related domains. These models will be integrated with the QuTiP packages, ensuring both compatibility and ease of use. Practically, this will allow users to select their preferred method of resolution when setting up the quantum control optimization problem. Additionally, I will produce documentation and examples to guide users in effectively utilizing these new features.

If you are interested in the stages of the project's development, take a look at the following posts.üëá
