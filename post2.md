# Community bonding period
## 23/5/2024

In May I participated online in the GSoC summit where it was explained how we contributors should best approach this experience and the importance of communicating with the mentors.
Additionally, an overview of the open-source world was provided, touching on topics such as AI, security, licenses, etc.  
Also in May, I attended a Q&A session of about an hour with the GSoC organizers. Some contributors asked questions mainly regarding the extensions of project durations and doubts about the stipend.

I participated in the first call with some QuTiP mentors. We introduced ourselves and discussed how to proceed during the community bonding period.

Since the project will be written mainly in python, just to refresh my knowledge, I completed the 16-hour course on YT *Harvard CS50â€™s Introduction to Programming with Python*. It was very well done, and I even learned a few new tricks :)

To be ready to write some code locally and test it I installed QuTiP and the `qutip-qoc` package in developer mode.  
The `qutip-qoc` package is a part of QuTiP and aims to provide advanced tools for the optimal control of quantum devices.
