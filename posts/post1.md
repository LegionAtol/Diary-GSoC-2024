# The Beginning
## 2/2/2024
I discovered QuTip in mid-December 2023 and from that moment I began to inform myself, read up and experiment, especially in the User Guide > Tutorials section on the QuTiP website, also making **contributions** on GitHub.
After a short time I contacted the community via email and explored various QuTiP social channels such as the Help Group.

After the projects related to GSoC 2024 came out and after **contacting** one of the **mentors**, Alex Pitchford, I decided that the project “1 - QuTiP Control ML Optimization” would be perfect for me, an opportunity and a challenge that would combine my main passions: computer science, mathematics and physics and more recent interest in artificial intelligence.

The first step, for a project of this importance, is certainly to start **researching** the recent and most relevant scientific papers in the field.
So I started researching by reading various scientific papers on QOC and ML, various articles, and even watching some videos on YouTube.
This phase is fundamental before starting to write code so I think it will take some time but it will allow me to define the best path to follow for the realization of the project.  

There are three main papers that I ended up presenting in my proposal. I chose these because they had good examples of how various RL techniques can be used in the QOC field, and most of the time they also included code.  

- A Tutorial on Optimal Control and Reinforcement Learning methods for Quantum Technologies [link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.07453)
- A Differentiable Programming Method for Quantum Control [link](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/ab9802/pdf)
- Global Optimization of Quantum Dynamics with AlphaZero Deep Exploration [link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.05672)
