# The Beginning
## 2/2/2024
I discovered QuTip in mid-December 2023 and from that moment I began to inform myself, read up and experiment, especially in the User Guide > Tutorials section on the QuTiP website, also making **contributions** on GitHub.
After a short time I contacted the community via email and explored various QuTiP social channels such as the Help Group.

After the projects related to GSoC 2024 came out and after **contacting** one of the **mentors**, Alex Pitchford, I decided that the project “1 - QuTiP Control ML Optimization” would be perfect for me, an opportunity and a challenge that would combine my main passions: computer science, mathematics and physics and more recent interest in artificial intelligence.

The first step, for a project of this importance, is certainly to start **researching** the recent and most relevant scientific papers in the field.
So I started researching by reading various scientific papers on QOC and ML, various articles, and even watching some videos on YouTube.
This phase is fundamental before starting to write code so I think it will take some time but it will allow me to define the best path to follow for the realization of the project.
